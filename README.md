## I'm John Ndigirigi
I'm a developer, I build full-stack web applications, cross-platform applications, and blockchain-based  applications. I'm interested in frontend engineering, backend engineering, and developing blockchain-based solutions. Currently, I'm building a Self-Sovereign Identity solution and contributing to a few full-stack web-based projects.
I'm open to opportunities relating to:
- Full-stack development with TypeScript, JavaScript, C#,  React JS, Next JS, React Native, Node JS, Express JS, and ,NET.
- Cardano & Ethereum blockchain-based application development. ie Writing Solidity smart contracts for Ethereum, and writing off-chain code interacting with Haskell and Aiken smart contracts for Cardano.
- Developing Self Sovereign Identity solutions.
- Developing software with  TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, Solidity, and Aiken programming languages.
